MERN stack is the idea of using Javascript/Node for full-stack web development.

## clone or download
```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/vinit-modi/Virtual-Farm-Market.git
$ yarn # or npm i
```

## project structure

# Usage (run full-stack app on your machine)

## Prerequisites
- [MongoDB](https://gist.github.com/nrollr/9f523ae17ecdbb50311980503409aeb3)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ^10.0.0
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

notice, you need the client and server runs concurrently in a different terminal session, to make them talk to each other

## Client-side usage(PORT: 3000)
```terminal
$ cd client          // go to client folder
$ yarn # or npm i    // npm install packages
$ npm run dev        // run it locally

// deployment for client app
$ npm run build // This will compile the react code using Webpack and generate a folder called docs in the root level
$ npm run start // This will run the files in docs, this behavior is the same as how gh-pages will run your static site
```

## Server-side usage(PORT: 3000)

run the script at the first level:

```terminal
// in the root level
$ cd server
```

### Start

```terminal
$ cd server   // go to server folder
$ npm i       // npm install packages
$ npm start
```
# Virtual-Farm-Market

"Virtual Farm Market" is a web-based project built on the MERN stack. Our Web App will connect farmers and customers, simplifying ordering fresh produce. Farmers can register on our platform to sell their products, while customers can directly purchase vegetables from local farms. Our platform incorporates a geolocation-based search feature, enabling customers to identify and connect with nearby farmers quickly. We also offer a self-pickup service, allowing customers to schedule the collection of their orders.

At its core, "Virtual Farm Market" leverages technology to address the challenge of obtaining fresh produce daily. By eliminating intermediaries and connecting farmers directly with customers, the project not only simplifies the procurement process but also promotes the support of local agriculture. The platform's user-friendly interface and geolocation features ensure a seamless experience for farmers and customers, enhancing the accessibility of fresh produce.

By fostering direct connections between farmers and consumers, "Virtual Farm Market" seeks to contribute to the growth of local farming communities. Through its technology-driven approach, this project offers a solution to a fundamental problem many families face‚Äîaccess to fresh, locally sourced vegetables. It promotes sustainability and strengthens the bond between consumers and the agricultural producers in their community.

Technology Description
For our project, we've decided to use the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack because of its outstanding features and widespread industry acceptance. MongoDB's NoSQL database offers scalability and flexibility, and Express.js makes server-side programming easier. React.js provides a dynamic and responsive user interface renowned for its component-based architecture. Our runtime environment, Node.js, guarantees effective server-side operations. We can embrace iterative development and seamless collaboration by combining these technologies with Agile methodology. This enables us to react to changing needs and build a solid, full-stack web application that aligns with contemporary software development practices. The MERN stack is an excellent option for our project because of this.
